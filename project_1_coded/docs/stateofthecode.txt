    Ey, im back.
    So, first things first, gotta stabilish 
    how we're gonna go about this shit.

    Anyway:
        as soon as big boy line gets initialized, it
        will calculate and save its points to a list according
        to its precision. Precision should be passed when initializing
        any line, else we'll have funny. I'm actually thinking
        of setting a hardcoded constant for this. Should be easier.

    aLRIGHT!
    Most of pointhandler is done. Circle got some
    cool new lambda functions that calculate 
    the x y pairs in a very fun parametric way.
    Figure is almost done. Next is building the
    allx and ally, which will be passed down to 
    matplotlib and this should be ultrafun!
