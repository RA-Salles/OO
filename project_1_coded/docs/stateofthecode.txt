    Ey, im back.
    So, first things first, gotta stabilish 
    how we're gonna go about this shit.

    Anyway:
        as soon as big boy line gets initialized, it
        will calculate and save its points to a list according
        to its precision. Precision should be passed when initializing
        any line, else we'll have funny. I'm actually thinking
        of setting a hardcoded constant for this. Should be easier.

    aLRIGHT!
    Most of pointhandler is done. Circle got some
    cool new lambda functions that calculate 
    the x y pairs in a very fun parametric way.
    Figure is almost done. Next is building the
    allx and ally, which will be passed down to 
    matplotlib and this should be ultrafun!

    Im feeling a little monkey like,
    i thought i made lambda funcs to the
    circle, only to find regular funcs.
    I promise to die someway somehow.

    fixed the funcs to be lambda.
    i think i actually finished the coding
    for the pointpack.
    Next should be a basic menu and done!

    Finallizing the very fucking annoying menu. 
    I really really hate creating this kind of stuff that 
    needs lots of string so the user has some kind of coherence 
    while using the program.
    Main is really easy. Gets the menu and starts it. menu
    takes over from there.
