        So it happens that git didn't save the content of the files
    i passed it in the lab, so now i will have to firebomb
    linus torvalds' house. Very fun!
        Anyway, i went ahead and constructed most of the code 
    for the drawer and the figures. So it happens that i will
    try to make this thing print the stuff with some kind of
    printf. THIS MAKES ME VERY FUCKING ANGRY BECAUSE
    I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM PIXELS PRINT PRETTY LIKE 
    SOME KIND OF CONSOLE (DOS) APPLICATION LIKE DOOM AND STUFF.
    Can't handle graphics, but the figures ***should*** work
    were you to transfer this bullshit to some kind of proper
    language. 
        If you're gonna do this, transfer it to python. My 
    pseudocode is typed mostly like python. 

    WHAT TO DO NEXT:
        1. GOTTA FINISH THE DRAWER 
        2. GOTTA MAKE SOMETHING LIKE A MENU OR SOMETHING
        3. GOTTA EAT YER MOTHER'S ASS 
        4. GOTTA USE THE N-WORD SOMEWHERE SPECIAL :>

    revving up my engine to finish this. Might take me about 
    1 or 2 hours. It's pseudo, so i can't actually test it, but 
    that's about it. 
    ALRIGHT! LET'S FUCKING DO IT!

    Alright! bossman said to get the code actually running.
    I'll use python and stuff and this should be ultrafunny.
    So, basically, this is the message of axing. I'm clipping this
    project and getting my hands actually dirty in trying to make 
    it run. Pseudocode my ass, we'll do it in python!
